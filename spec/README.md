To start with the project:
    1) clone the project onto your device: git clone https://gitlab.com/lucasKO2810/saleor.git
    2) launch all services with command: ./start_up, which will run `docker-compose -f ./saleor-platform/docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.prod.yml build` and finally `docker-compose up`
    3) If there was no errors, it should already be running on your local machine
